# Applications and Spaces

New types of content (objects) contributed to the platform in form of `Applications`.

Examples of applications are: Chat (contribute messages), Tasks (contribute tasks), and Recruiting (contribute vacancies, interviews, candidates, etc.).

Content (application objects) stored within `Space`s. Space is a security mechanism and each space can be configured with permissions for particular system user.

On the application level a `Space` can have more relevant application-specific name, so for `Chat` application space can be called a `Channel`. For task application space may be called a `Project` and so on.

All above gives us Application -> Spaces navigation structure for the entire platform content.
